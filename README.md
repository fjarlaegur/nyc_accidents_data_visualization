My personal attempt at creating a data visualisation dashboard based on [this](https://github.com/fjarlaegur/data_visualisation_project) project. I decided to add a few data visualisation features and categories of data to visualise.  

Libraries used:  
- Streamlit
- pandas
- plotly

Dashboard: https://nyc-accidents-visualisation.streamlit.app/
